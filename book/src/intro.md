# Introduction

Crane is a CLI tool that allows you to create *bricks* that you can later add to any project.

A brick is an instruction. It can be a file that gets added, a command that executes or lines getting replaced in a target file.

## Quick Examples

### License

Instead of having to look up and copy your desired license from the web, you can create a brick out of it and then run `crane add some-license`.
