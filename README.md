# crane 🏗️

Easily add bricks (files or snippets) to your projects.

🧱 A brick is an instruction. It can be a file that gets added, a command that
executes or lines getting replaced in a target file.

> 🚧 crane is currently being worked on :D
> Some features that are already documented don't work yet
> and everything could change until a stable release!
